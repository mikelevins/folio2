# folio 2 reference
version 2.0.2

## as

A generic, extensible conversion utility.

**Package:** net.bardcode.folio.as<br>
**Exports:** as

**as** exports a single symbol named **as**, which names a generic
  function. The function **as** is an extensible type-conversion
  utility. It can be specialized as-needed to provide conversions
  among arbitrary types.

The exportation of a single name is intentional. It's meant to make it
easy and convenient to `USE` or `IMPORT` the **as** function and
extend it as-needed.

#### Reference

**as** *type* *value* &key &allow-other-keys  => Anything  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a new value of type *type* that is in some sense equivalent to
*value*.

**#[&lt;type&gt;]** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Reader macro*]<br>

The reader macro #[&lt;type&gt;] is a **type constraint**. It attempts
to convert the next value read to the specified type. For example,

    CL-USER> '(1 2)
    (1 2)
    
but:
    
    CL-USER> #[vector]'(1 2)
    #(1 2)

The reader macro works only when there is a method defined on **as**
that is applicable to the supplied value and type.

## boxes
Mutable containers.

**Package:** net.bardcode.folio.boxes<br>
**Exports:** box box? set-box! unbox

The **box** type is a mutable container for arbitrary values. The
functions **unbox** and **set-box!** can be used to retrieve and
replace the value stored in a **box**.

Boxes provide a way to introduce mutability piecemeal into immutable
and pure-functional data structures. As an example, we can use a
pure-functional implementation of finite maps, but store the value
elements in boxes so that they can be destructively updated. All
operations on the finite map as a whole and on its keys remain purely
functional, but we can destructively modify the values stored on the
keys.

A type definition establishes the **box** type as a synonym for a
**cons** cell whose **car** element is the keyword **:BOX**.

#### Reference

**as** 'box *value* => *box*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a new box that contains *value*.

**box**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Type*]<br>

A **box** is a mutable container for a value. folio represents a
**box** as a **cons** whose **car** is the keyword **:box**.

**box** *value* => *box*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a new **box** containing *value*.

**box?** *value* => Generalized Boolean  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a true value if *value* is a **box**, and a false value
otherwise.

**make** 'box &key (*value* nil) => Anything  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a new **box** whose initial value is *value*.

**set-box!** *box* *value* => Anything  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Replaces the value of *box* with *value*, returning *value*.

**unbox** box => Anything  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns the value stored in *box*.

**setf** (unbox *box*) *value* => *value*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Replaces the value of *box* with *value*, returning *value*.

## functions

Tools for working with functions.

**Package:** net.bardcode.folio.functions<br>
* **Exports:** $ ^ -> cascade compose conjoin disjoin flip fn function? functional?
           generic-function? method? partial rpartial

The **functions** package provides a set of tools for working with
functions and for making functional style more convenient in Common
Lisp.

#### Reference

**$** *fn* *arg1* *arg2* ... *argk*  => Anything  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Macro*]<br>

A compact synonym for Common Lisp FUNCALL. This macro is not intended
as a replacement for FUNCALL, but as a convenience for cases where the
longer name would be bulky or awkward, or when the clarity of
functional code benefits from brevity.

**^** (*arg1* *arg2* ... *argk*) *body*  => Anything  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Macro*]<br>

Returns a newly-created function. **^** is shorthand for **lambda**;
it accepts the same arguments and has the same effect. Its purpose is
to provide a more succinct version of **lambda** for those cases when
the longer form would be verbose. An example is in passing an
anonymous function inline to a search.

A synonym for **^** is **fn**.

**->** *f1*..*fk* => *fx*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Macro*]<br>

Returns a function *fx* that accepts *k* arguments. When applied to
*k* values, the function yields *k* results, applying *f1* to the
first argument, *f2* to the second, and so on. Combines usefully with
**cascade**, e.g:

    (cascade (a b c) 
      (-> f1 f2 f3)
      (-> g1 g2 g3)
      (-> h1 h2 h3)) 
    => v1 v2 v3

where *v1* is `(h1 (g1 (f1 a)))`, *v2* is `(h2 (g2 (f2 b)))`, and *v3*
is `(h3 (g3 (f3 c)))`.

<br>

**cascade** (*arg1*..*argk*) *f1*..*fn*) => *val1*..*valk*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Macro*]<br>

*f1* through *fn* are all functions that accept *k* arguments and
*return k* values. **cascade** applies *f1* to arguments
**arg1*..*argk*. The *k* output values become the inputs to
**f2*. *f2*'s outputs are the inputs to *f3*, and so on. The outputs
*of *fn* are *val1*..*valk*

<br>

**compose** (*fn1*...*fnk*) => *fnx*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Macro*]<br>

Returns a new function *fnx* which performs the computations
represented by the functions *fn1* through *fnk*.

Passing an argument A to *fnx* has the same effect as evaluating this
expression:

    (*fn1* (*fn2* (*fn3*...(*fnk* A))))

<br>

**conjoin** *fn1*...*fnk* => *fnx*
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Macro*]<br>

Returns a new function *fnx* which performs the computations
represented by the functions *fn1* through *fnk* as if they are
arguments to an **and** expression.

Passing an argument A to *fnx* has the same effect as evaluating this
expression:

    (and (fn1 A)
         (fn2 A)
         ...
         (fnk A))

<br>
**disjoin** *fn1*...*fnk* => *fnx*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Macro*]<br>

Returns a new function *fnx* which performs the computations
represented by the functions *fn1* through *fnk* as if they are
arguments to an **or** expression.

Passing an argument A to *fnx* has the same effect as evaluating this
expression:

    (or (fn1 A)
         (fn2 A)
         ...
         (fnk A))


<br>
**flip** *fn1*  => *fn2*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Function*]<br>

Returns a new function *fn2* that performs the same computation as
*fn1*, but taking its arguments in the opposite order. *fn1* must be a
function that accepts two required arguments.

<br>

**flip** is a somewhat specialized combinator, but its use-case
is surprisingly common. As an example, consider filtering a list
values for those that are members of another list. You can write that
code this way:

    (filter (partial (flip 'member) $the-list)
            the-values)
            
The reason the call to **flip** is needed is that **member** takes its
arguments in the wrong order: its first argument is the object you're
testing for membership; its second is the list you're searching for
members. **flip** enables us to reverse the order of
arguments. (Another approach would be to use **rpartial** instead of
**partial** to construct the filter function.)

Because circumstances like this one arise often, **flip** is often
useful.

<br>
**fn**   => Anything  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Macro*]<br>

Returns a newly-created function. **fn** is shorthand for **lambda**;
it accepts the same arguments and has the same effect. Its purpose is
to provide a more succinct version of **lambda** for those cases when
the longer form would be verbose. An example is in passing an
anonymous function inline to a search.

A synonym for **fn** is **^**.

<br>
**function?**  *thing*  => Boolean  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns true if *thing* is a function and false otherwise.

<br>
**functional?**  *thing*  => Boolean  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns true if *thing* is a funcallable object of type function,
generic function, or method, and false otherwise.

<br>
**generic-function?**  *thing*  => Boolean  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns true if *thing* is a generic function and false otherwise.

<br>

**method?** *thing*  => Boolean  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns true if *thing* is a method and false otherwise.

<br>
**partial** *f1* *arg1*..*argk* => *f2*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Function*]<br>

Returns a left section of the function *f1*, created by partially
applying *f1* to the arguments *arg1* through *argk*. These arguments
must be some of the arguments required by *f1*; *rpartial* partially
applies *f1* to them binding them to the leftmost required arguments.

As an example, if the function **foo** requires four arguments named
a, b, c, and d, then

    (partial 'foo 1 2)
    
creates a left section in which the parameters a and b are bound to
the values 1 and 2. Applying the left section to the values 3 and 4
then bind c and d to 3 and 4 and then compute and return the result of
the call to foo.

<br>
**rpartial** *f1* *arg1*..*argk* => *f2*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Function*]<br>

Returns a right section of the function *f1*, created by partially
applying *f1* to the arguments *arg1* through *argk*. These arguments
must be some of the arguments required by *f1*; *rpartial* partially
applies *f1* to them binding them to the rightmost required arguments.

As an example, if the function **foo** requires four arguments named
a, b, c, and d, then

    (rpartial 'foo 3 4)
    
creates a right section in which the parameters c and d are bound to
the values 3 and 4. Applying the right section to the values 1 and 2
then bind a and b to 1 and 2 and then compute and return the result of
the call to foo.


## make

A generic, extensible utility for constructing values.

**Package:** net.bardcode.folio.make<br>
**Exports:** make

The **make** package exports the extensible generic function
**make**. By specializing this generic function you can implement
custom constructors for arbitrary types.

**make** is defined to accept keyword arguments, so that your
  specializations can use keyword parameters to exercise fine control
  over constructor behavior.

The exportation of a single name is intentional. It's meant to make it
easy and convenient to `USE` or `IMPORT` the **make** function and
extend it as-needed.

#### Reference

**make** *type* &key &allow-other-keys  => Anything  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a new instance of *type*, constructed according to the
specifications passed in the keyword parameters.

## maps

Finite map types with a common API

**Package:** net.bardcode.folio.maps<br>
**Exports:** alist alist?
   contains-key? contains-value?
   get-key
   keys
   map map? :merge
   plist plist? put-key
   values
   wb-map wb-map?

The **maps** package provides implementations of functional finite
maps and a uniform API for working with them. Implementations of the
**maps** functions are provided for **alists**, **plists**, and FSet's
**wb-map** representation of finite maps. Adding additional
representations of maps is a simple matter of specializing the generic
functions in the **Maps** package.

An obvious question is why the **Maps** functions are not specialized
on Common Lisp's **hash-table** type; surely a hash-table is a kind of
finite map?

The reason that folio doesn't specialize the **Maps** functions for
**hash-table** is that the **Maps** protocol is a functional protocol;
it assumes the maps it operates on are immutable. The whole advantage
of a hash-table is that it provides efficient lookup and update
through destructive modification of the table. It's certainly
*possible* to implement a purely-functional API for Common Lisp's
hash-tables, but it would be perverse to do so, since it would
squander all of the performance advantages of hash-tables.


#### Reference

<br>
**alist**   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Type*]<br>

A Lisp list whose elements are pairs, represented as **cons**
cells. The left element of each pair is a key; the right element is a
value associated with the key.

<br>
**alist** (*key1* . *value1*) (*key2* . *value2*) ...  (*keyk* . *valuek*) => *alist* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Macro*]<br>

Returns a new **map** represented as an **alist**. The keys and values
are as given by *key1*...*keyk* and *value1*...*valuek*.

<br>
**alist?** *thing* => Boolean  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns true if *thing* appears to be an **alist**, and false
otherwise. **alist?** considers a value an **alist** if it's a
**cons**, if it's a proper list, and if each element is also a
**cons**.

<br>
**contains-key?** *map* *key* &key (test 'eql) =>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns true if *map* contains *key*, and false otherwise. The
function passed in the **test** parameter is used to test whether
*key* matches a key in *map*.

**test** is ignored when *map* is a **wb-map**.

<br>
**contains-value?** *map* *value* &key (test 'eql)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns true if *map* contains *value*, and false otherwise. The
function passed in the **test** parameter is used to test whether
*value* matches a value in *map*.

**test** is ignored when *map* is a **wb-map**.

<br>
**get-key** *map* *key* &key (test 'eql)(default nil) =>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns the value associated in *map* with *key*, or, if *key* is not
present in *map*, returns *default*.

**test** is ignored when *map* is a **wb-map**.

<br>
**keys** *map* => *keys*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a sequence of *keys* that appear in *map*.

<br>
**make** 'map &key (contents nil) => *map* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a new **map** instance. The keys and values of the new **map**
are given as a **plist** passed in **contents**. The representation of
the **map** is chosen by folio, but you can pass it to **as** to
obtain a particular type of **map**.

<br>
**map?** *thing* => Boolean  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns true if *thing* is a **map**, and false otherwise.

<br>
**merge** *map1* *map2* => *map3*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a new **map** of the same type as *map1*. The new **map**
contains all the keys present in both *map1* and *map2*. Where a key
is present in both **maps*, the value from *map2* is chosen to be in
*map3*.

The function passed in the **test** parameter is used to test whether
a *key* in *map2* matches a key in *map1*.

<br>
**plist**   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Type*]<br>

A Lisp list with an even number of elements, representing a
**map**. Elements at even-numbered indexes must be atoms, and are
treated as keys. Elements at odd-numbered indexes are treated as the
values associated with the keys, with each one associated with the
atom that immediately precedes it.

<br>
**plist** *key1* *value1* *key2* *value2* ... *keyk* *valuek* => *plist*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Function*]<br>

Returns a new **map** represented as a **plist**. The keys and values
are as given by *key1*...*keyk* and *value1*...*valuek*.

<br>
**plist?** *thing* => Boolean  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Function*]<br>

Returns true if *thing* appears to be a **plist**, and false
otherwise. **plist?** considers a vaue to be a **plist** if it's a
**cons**, if it's a proper list, and if every even-indexed element is
an atom.

<br>
**put-key** *map1* *key* *value* &key (test 'eql) => *map2*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a new map that contains all the keys in *map1*, but in
addition contains *key* with the associated value *value*. If *map1*
contains *key* then its associated value is replaced in *map2* by
*value*.

<br>
**values** *map* => *sequence*  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns a sequence of all the values contained in *map*.

<br>
**wb-map**   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Type*]<br>

A weight-balanced tree that represents a finite map. This type is
provided by the FSet library and supported by folio's **Maps** API.

<br>
**wb-map?** *thing* => Boolean  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Generic function*]<br>

Returns true if *thing* is an instance of an FSet **wb-map**, and
false otherwise.

**{ *key1* *val1* ... *keyK* *valK* }** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Reader macro*]<br>

The reader macro { *key1* *val1* ... *keyK* *valK* } constructs a
**Map** value whose keys are *key1* ... *keyK* and whose corresponding
values are *val1* ...  *valK*.

    CL-USER> { :a 1 :b 2}
    { :A 1 :B 2 }

folio chooses the type of map created, but you can use the **as**
utility to convert to a type of your choice. In version 2.0, the
default map type is FSET:WB-MAP.

## pairs

A simple data structure with left and right slots. An extensible
synonym for `cons`.

**Package:** `net.bardcode.folio.pair`<br>
**Exports:** `left pair pair? right set-left! set-right!`

The `pair` type is an extensible synonym for Lisp's `cons` type. Any
type for which the `pair` functions are specialized is a pair, which
means that you can implement your own representations of pairs.

A second use for the `pair` functions is to clearly communicate
intent: using the `pair` functions with `cons` cells communicates that
the programmer intends to treat them as pairs of values, as opposed to
any of the many other uses to which `cons` cells can be put.

#### Reference

**`as`** *Generic function* <br>
`as 'pair value => pair`<br>

Returns a new `pair` equivalent to `value`. As an example, `(as 'pair
(vector 1 2 3))` returns `(1 2 3)`.

**`left`** *Generic function* <br>
`left pair => Anything`<br>

Returns the value of the `left` slot of `pair`.

**`make`** *Generic function* <br>
`make 'pair &key (left nil)(right nil) => pair`<br>

Returns a newly-constructed `pair` whose `left` slot contains `left`,
and whose `right` slot contains `right`.

**`pair`** *Generic function* <br>
`pair left right => pair`<br>

Returns a newly-constructed `pair` whose `left` slot contains `left`,
and whose `right` slot contains `right`.

**`pair?`** *Generic function* <br>
`pair? p => Generalized Boolean`<br>

Returns a true value if `p` is a `pair`, and a false value otherwise.

**`right`** *Generic function* <br>
`right pair => Anything`<br>

Returns the value of the `right` slot of `pair`.

**`set-left!`** *Generic function* <br>
`set-left! p value => value`<br>

Replaces the value of the `left` slot of `p` with `value`, returning
`value`.

**`setf left`** *Generic function* <br>
`setf (left p) val => val`<br>

Replaces the value of the `left` slot of `p` with `value`, returning
`value`.

**`set-right!`** *Generic function* <br>
`set-right! p value => value`<br>

Replaces the value of the `right` slot of `p` with `value`, returning
`value`.

**`setf right`** *Generic function* <br>
`setf (right p) val => val`<br>

Replaces the value of the `right` slot of `p` with `value`, returning
`value`.

## sequences

Objects that represent ordered sequences of values. An extension and
generalization of Common Lisp's sequence type.

**[** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Reader macro*]<br>

**[ *val1* ... *valK* }** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Reader macro*]<br>

The reader macro `[` *val1* ...  *valK* `]` constructs a sequence
value whose values are *val1* ...  *valK*.

    CL-USER> [1 2 3]
    (1 2 3)

folio chooses the type of sequence to construct. You can use `as` to
obtain a sequence of a specified value.


**`acons`** *Generic function* <br>
`acons k v sequence => sequence'`<br>

Returns a new sequence to which the pair `(k . v)` has been added as
an element. `acons` extends Common Lisp's `ACONS`, enabling values of
type `VECTOR` and `FSET:WB-SEQ` to be treated as association lists.

**`add-first`** *Generic function* <br>
`add-first val sequence => sequence'`<br>

Returns a new sequence whose first element is `val` and whose
remaining elements are the elements of `sequence`. Similar to Common
Lisp's `CONS`, except that `SEQUENCE` may be a value of any type that
folio treats as a sequence.

**`add-last`** *Generic function* <br>
`add-last sequence val => sequence'`<br>

Returns a new sequence whose last element is `val` and whose remaining
elements are the elements of `sequence`. Similar to `add-first` except
that it adds the new value to the end of the sequence rather than the
beginning.

**`any`** *Generic function* <br>
`any sequence => Anything`<br>

Returns a randomly-selected element of `sequence`. `any` internally
uses Common Lisp `RANDOM` to choose the element returned; the
selection of an element to return is therefore affected by the value
of `*RANDOM-STATE*`, and by the implementation of `RANDOM`.

**`append`** *Function* <br>
`append sequence1 sequence2 ... sequenceN => sequence'`<br>

Returns a new sequence constructed by appending the input sequences
one after another in order. folio attempts to make a result that is of
the same type, or failing that, a generalization of the type of the
leftmost input sequence. `append` is a generalization of Common Lisp
`APPEND` that works with all types that folio treats as sequences, and
that can be further extended by writing methods on `binary-append`.

**`apportion`** *Function* <br>
`apportion sequence &rest fn1 fn2 ... fnN => sequence1 sequence2 ... sequenceN`<br>

Returns a number of sequences equal to the number of functions `fn`,
`fn2`, ... `fnN`. `apportion` filters the elements of `sequence` by
applying each of the input functions to each element of `sequence` in
order. Those elements for which `fn1` returns a true value become
elements of `sequence1`; those for which `fn2` returns a true value
become elements of `sequence2`; and so on.

**`assoc`** *Generic function* <br>
`assoc k sequence &key (key 'cl:identity) (test 'cl:eql) => Anything`<br>

Returns the first element of `sequence` whose key is the same as `k`,
where the key is defined as the value returned by applying the `key`
parameter to the element, and "the same" is defined by applying the
`test` to `k` and the value returned by the `key`.`assoc` extends
Common Lisp's `ASSOC`, enabling values of type `VECTOR` and
`FSET:WB-SEQ` to be treated as association lists.

**`assoc-if`** *Generic function* <br>
`assoc-if predicate sequence &key (key 'cl:identity) => Anything`<br>

Applies `key` to each element of `sequence`, and then applies
`predicate` to the value returned by `key`. Returns the first element
for which `predicate` returns a true value. `assoc-if` extends Common
Lisp's `ASSOC-IF`, enabling values of type `VECTOR` and `FSET:WB-SEQ`
to be treated as association lists.

**`assoc-if-not`** *Generic function* <br>
`assoc-if-not predicate sequence &key (key 'cl:identity) => Anything`<br>

Applies `key` to each element of `sequence`, and then applies
`predicate` to the value returned by `key`. Returns the first element
for which `predicate` returns a false value. `assoc-if-not` extends
Common Lisp's `ASSOC-IF-NOT`, enabling values of type `VECTOR` and
`FSET:WB-SEQ` to be treated as association lists.


**`binary-append`** *Function* <br>
`binary-append sequence1 sequence2 => sequence'`<br>

Returns a new sequence constructed by appending the input sequences
one after the other in order. folio attempts to make a result that is
of the same type, or failing that, a generalization of the type of the
leftmost input sequence. Normally it's more convenient to call
`append`, which operates on any number of sequences. The primary use
of `binary-append` is in extending `append` to work with new types:
adding `binary-append` methods that are specialized on new types
enables `append` to work with those types.

**`by`** *Generic function* <br>
`by n sequence => sequence'`<br>

Returns a new sequence made up of subsequences of `sequence`, each of
length `n`. `by` splits the input sequence into subsequences of length
`n`; for example,

    (by 3 "abcdefghi") => #("abc" "def" "ghi")
    
If the number of elements in `sequence` is not a whole multiple of `n`
then the last subsequence is shorter than `n`. This also means that if
`n` is greater than the length of `sequence`, then the result sequence
contains a single subsequence that is equal to `sequence`.

**`count`** *Generic function* <br>
`count item sequence &key (start 0) (end nil) (key 'cl:identity) (test 'cl:eql) => Integer`<br>

Returns a count of elements in `sequence` that are the same as
`item`. "The same as" means that applying `key` to the element returns
a value that is equal to `item`, with `test` used as the equality
test. `count` extends Common Lisps's `COUNT` to work with all types
that folio treats as sequences.

**`count-if`** *Generic function* <br>
`count-if predicate sequence &key (start 0) (end nil) (key 'cl:identity) => Integer`<br>

Returns a count of elements in `sequence` satisfy
`predicate`. `predicate` is applied to the value produced by applying
`key` to each element, and the count is incremented for each element
that produces a true result. `count-if` extends Common Lisp's
`COUNT-IF` to work with all types that folio treats as sequences.

**`count-if-not`** *Generic function* <br>
`count-if-not predicate sequence &key (start 0) (end nil) (key 'cl:identity) => Integer`<br>

Returns a count of elements in `sequence` do not sastisfy
`predicate`. `predicate` is applied to the value produced by applying
`key` to each element, and the count is incremented for each element
that produces a false result. `count-if-not` extends Common Lisp's
`COUNT-IF-NOT` to work with all types that folio treats as sequences.

*key*.


**`range`** *Generic function* <br>
`range start end &key (by 1) => sequence`<br>

one greater or less than *end*, depending on whether the result is
monotonically increasing or decreasing.

    FOLIO> (range 1 10)
    (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

    FOLIO> (range 10 1)
    (10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2)

**`reduce`** *Generic function* <br>
`reduce fn sequence  &key (key 'cl:identity) (initial-value nil) => Anything`<br>

Returns a value computed by applying *fn* to successive pairs of
values found in *sequence*. Before applying *fn*, `reduce` applies
*key* to each of the two values to obtain the value that is to be
combined. *initial-value* provides a starting value that is combined
with the first element of *sequence*. A common idiom is to combine the
results of a reduction into a list, and so the default value of
*initial-value* is the empty list--`nil`. `reduce` is a generic
synonym for Common Lisp's `reduce`.


**`remove`** *Generic function* <br>

Returns a new series of elements from *series*. `take-while`
collects elements of *series* from left to right until it finds an
element of *series* that fails to satisfy *predicate*. It then
returns the found elements that satisfied *predicate* thus far.

**`unzip`** *Generic function* <br>
`unzip series1 => series2, series3`

*series1* must be a series of **pairs**. `unzip` returns two
 values: the left elements of the pairs, and the right elements of the
 pairs.


**`zip`** *Generic function* <br>
`zip series1 series2 => series3`

Returns a series of pairs in which the left elements of the pairs
are the elements of *series1*, and the right elements of the pairs
are the elements of *series2*.

## taps

Functions that generate series of values from streams, sequences, and
other data structures. Taps can be used to present data in a form that
is convenient for sequence and series operations.

#### Reference

**`characters`** *Generic function* <br>
`characters string-or-stream => a series of characters`

Returns a series of characters read from *string-or-stream*.

**`elements`** *Generic function* <br>
`elements sequence => a series of values found as elements of a sequence`

Returns a series of the elements of *sequence*.

**lines`** *Generic function* <br>
`lines string-or-stream => a series of lines (strings)`

Returns a series of strings read one line at a time from *string-or-stream*.

**`octets`** *Generic function* <br>
`octets sequence-or-stream => a series of octets`

Returns a series of octets read from *string-or-stream*.

**`slots`** *Generic function* <br>
`slots map-or-instance => a series of pairs`

Returns a series pairs in which the left element of each pair is a
slot name of *map-or-instance*, and the right element is the
corresponding value.

**`objects`** *Generic function* <br>
`objects string-or-stream => a series of Lisp objects produced by READ`

Returns a series of objects read by the Lisp reader from
*string-or-stream*.

## Bugs

Higher-order folio functions--those that accept functions as
arguments--generally do not work correctly when passed an fbound
symbol. You must use an actual function object instead--that is, an
expression like `(function foo)` or `#'foo`.
